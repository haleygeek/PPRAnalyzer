# PPRAnalyzer
A Matlab version of the original python scripts upgraded with a GUI interface for better user experience.

Was created in a very short amount of time for a labmate who needed it ASAP but was not comfortable using a command line interface
There are many planned upgrades
  1. A bug that will re-write over the original file if the worksheet name is the same as the filename
  2. Inner workings need to be re-designed to work with arrays as matrixes instead of separating them into individual variables
  3. Add plotting functions and GUI fields for manipulating scale, axes, colors, symbols, etc.
